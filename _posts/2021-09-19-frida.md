Creating a case file is something done on a very regular basis with Digital Forensics, I wondered how easily this process could be automated and streamlined, so I had a go at writing a script for the entire process!

### The Background
Within my current and previous workplaces, the case creation has normally involved just manually copying a template folder or running a batch script and changing what is necessary, as well as creating each set of folders for each exhibit type manually. My goal would be to make this as user friendly as possible, creating all of the files needed and structure without having to copy in or run multiple scripts, while also offering the ability to add some template keywords and some fail-safes to stop any overwritting of data.
