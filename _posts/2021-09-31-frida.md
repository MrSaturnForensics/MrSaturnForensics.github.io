At the time of writing this blog, this third-party photo vault application **com.enchantedcloud.photovault** is the first result on the google play store when searching for **"photo vault"** making it the perfect target for reverse engineering as it is most likely to appear in a real life scenario.

I then started of this process by recovering the **android application package** (APK) of the application from an extraction of a handset with the app installed.
Once this was obtained I then used a tool called **JADX** which would decompile the application, displaying the structure of the code. 

__An *APK* file is a ZIP archive in a JAR format, used for installation of an application on Android._
