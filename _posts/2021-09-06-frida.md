At the time of writing this blog, this third-party photo vault application **com.enchantedcloud.photovault** is the first result and number one result on the google play store when searching for **"photo vault"** making it the perfect target for reverse engineering as it is most likely to appear in a real life scenario.

I started the process of looking into this application by recovering the **android application package** (APK) of the application from an extraction of a handset with the app installed.
Once this was obtained I then used a tool called **JADX** which would decompile the APK, displaying the structure of the code. 

_An **APK** file is a ZIP archive in a JAR format, used for installation of an application on Android._

My next step was to try look for some classes of interest within the code, I was looking to find out how the application encrypts it's data, as well as how it may store it.

Eventually I stumbled across **com.privatephotovault.crypto.AESRSAEncryptor**, and in this I found a class called **k.j.d.a.a0.c**, this contained the following code snippet which led me to believe that the encryption used is **AES-GCM** encryption.

_**AES-GCM** encryption has four inputs for authenticated encryption: the secret key, initialization vector (IV) (sometimes called a nonce), the plaintext itself, and optional additional authentication data (AAD). The nonce and AAD are passed in the clear. There are two outputs: the ciphertext, which is exactly the same length as the plaintext, and an authentication tag (the "tag"). The tag is sometimes called the message authentication code (MAC) or integrity check value (ICV)._

Detailed below this, I believe I had found both the encryption and decryption process based on the layout and the usage of the code. 

**Encryption Method**

**Decryption Method**

Now was the time to look further into this class, I was going to use **FRIDA** to hook onto the that class, in a live running version of Private Photo Vault. 
I set this up via using an Android Emulator with Android Studio, and then running Frida-Server, which would spawn the application and run alongside it giving back return values for different functions within the class.
