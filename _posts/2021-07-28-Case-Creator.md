Creating a case file is something done on a very regular basis with Digital Forensics, I wondered how easily this process could be automated and streamlined, so I had a go a writing a script!

Within my current / previous workplaces, the case creation has normally involved just manually copying a template folder and changing what is necessary, as well as creating each set of folders for each exhibit manually, specifying the device type.
