Rooting an Android device can be useful for a number of reasons, however the purpose for myself is to use as a device of which I can run applications with FRIDA on which will be covered in a later post. 

### WARNING: Although rooting should be a fairly straight forward process, it is possible to brick a device attempting it, proceed with caution!
