### My Background

I'm Chris, a digital forensic investigator who works for law enforcement within the UK. 

I have worked in digital forensics for 3+ years, both within the public and private sector. I'm interested in exploring what is possible to achieve with R & D capabilities with programming, password cracking and reverse engineering.
